9:16 vertical aspect ratio, ultra-realistic smartphone mirror selfie of a South Asian woman in her late 20s to early 30s, taken indoors near a window during daytime. Close-up framing from collarbone to top of head.
She is holding a phone that partially covers one side of her face, looking slightly downward with a calm, neutral expression.
Hair is dark and tied back naturally with loose flyaways and baby hairs. Wearing a light grey cotton hoodie with true fabric texture, clearly separated from skin tone (no blending). Small silver stud or geometric earrings. Fingerails natural nude with subtle red nail detail.
Skin realism is the focus:
Visible pores and fine micro-texture
Natural acne marks with organic variation (not patterned)
Uneven pigmentation and subtle redness
Natural oil sheen only on high points (cheekbone, nose), matte elsewhere
No symmetry correction
Skin looks healthy and alive, not dull, not glossy - luminous due to real light only, not effects. No retouching, no smoothing, no beauty filters. Natural imperfections preserved.
Color & light (IMPORTANT):
Real daylight with slight warmth, not neutral grey
Natural contrast (not flat, not cinematic)
Accurate white balance
True-to-life colors - skin tones rich and dimensional, hoodie clearly grey, phone clearly dark
No faded, dusty, pastel, or washed-out colors
Camera behavior: phone-camera realism, slight edge softness, natural focus falloff, subtle sensor grain.
Overall aesthetic: modern, clean, minimal, intimate, non-commercial, editorial-documentary feel. Feels like a real person, real skin, real moment.
Strict negatives: faded colors, pastel tones, beige aesthetic, flat lighting, overexposed whites, Al glow, plastic skin, skincare-ad look, studio lighting, cartoon or 3D style, text or logos.
